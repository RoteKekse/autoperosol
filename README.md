## About TFSCO
The Thin-film solar cell ontology (TFSCO) is a domain ontology that provides a modell  of the manufacturing and characterization of perovskite solar cells. The TFSCO has been under development since 2022. The OWL-File was created using [Protégé](https://protege.stanford.edu/). Protégé may be used for viewing and editing the ontology.

The TFSCO imports axioms from the following ontologies: [CHMI (Chemical Methods Ontology)](https://github.com/rsc-ontologies/rsc-cmo), [RO (Relation Ontology](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/ro.html), [PATO (Phenotype and trait ontology](http://obofoundry.org/ontology/pato.html), [CHEBI (Chemical entities of biological interest)](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ols/ontologies/chebi), [IAO (Information Artifact ontology](https://github.com/information-artifact-ontology/IAO)
